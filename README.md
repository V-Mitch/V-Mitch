**About:**  
I have fun working on research projects that involves statistical analysis, forecasting, time-series and optimization to name a few. I also enjoy wild-camping!
  
Here, I share some of my personal projects. The most recent repositories I've created:  

${\color{SeaGreen}Machine \space Learning \space Classification \space Problem:}$
- "odds": Pulling data from an API, cleaning and organizing it through functions and finally developing a **Classification Machine Learning Model** to see if it can measure up against predictions made in academic papers and if it is comparable to the solutions of the public betting markets.

${\color{Plum}Bayesian \space Filtering \space and \space StateSpaceModelling:}$
- "track_ssm": A **State-Space Model** created to track the fitness level and predict the performance of 100m athletes. Bayesian logic and graphical depiction of the process are the focus in this project.
  
${\color{MidnightBlue}TimeSeries \space Regressions:}$
- "FM_thesis": A study on the evolving impact of Inflation numbers and other announced macro-related variables on currency prices.
